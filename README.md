# Comprehensive C++ Programming Series at Portland State University

## Repository Introduction

This repository presents a curated collection of 13 C++ programs and 2 Python programs, each reflecting a key stage in my comprehensive learning journey through the computer science courses at Portland State University. These programs begin with fundamental C++ basics and progressively delve into advanced topics, showcasing a diverse range of C++ features and programming techniques.

## Project Breakdown

- **Initial Programs (1-5)**: Focus on C++ basics, such as variable types, standard I/O, control flow, functions, and basic error handling.
- **Mid-Level Programs (6-10)**: Transition to more complex topics, including file I/O, memory management, pointers and references, and the introduction of STL (Standard Template Library).
- **Advanced Programs C++ (11-13)**: Delve into sophisticated aspects of C++, including template programming, exception handling, advanced data structures and algorithms, polymorphism, and resource management.
- **Advanced Programs Python (14-15)**: Incorporate previous advanced concepts into a new language. Includes OOP principles: Hierachichal design, inheritance, overloading, and testing on an AVL and LLL implementation.

## Learning Trajectory

- **Core Language Proficiency**: Establishing a strong foundation in C++ syntax and basic programming constructs.
- **Applied Object-Oriented Concepts**: Implementing classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and exploring polymorphism in-depth.
- **Advanced C++ Features**: Gaining proficiency in complex C++ functionalities, such as the STL, smart pointers, and concurrency.

## Demonstrated Skills

- **Versatile Problem-Solving**: Tackling a wide range of problems, from simple algorithmic challenges to complex system designs.
- **Code Efficiency and Optimization**: Focusing on writing efficient, optimized C++ code, considering both time and space complexities.
- **Practical and Theoretical Integration**: Effectively applying theoretical computer science principles in practical coding scenarios.

## Academic Growth

These programs represent the base of my Computer Science knowledge gained at Portland State University, underscoring a dedicated and evolving engagement with C++ programming and a strong capability for applying these concepts anywhere else.
